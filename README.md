### REMINDR

##About:
Our app aims to solve the problem of wasted consumption, that is we think of all the things we want to consume - movies, books, tv, video games, etc - but we end up defaulting to our go-tos when we actually have free time.  This app aims to make our consumption more productive, to actually remind us to try the new book or tv show we’ve been wanting to check out.

Let’s say you’re at work and your co-worker tells you about a cool new show.  You think to yourself, “hey, yeah I’d like to check that out.”  Where do you make a note of that?  How do you remember to watch that when you have free time instead of just queueing up “It’s Always Sunny” like you always do? Our app aims to give those reminders a special home and make them easily sharable with your friends.  

If successful, you’ll never waste a wasted moment again.

##Problem Statement:

User needs a way to collect content because they forget what to do during down
time.

##Hypothesis:

We believe that by developing a reminder platform for people who are busy and get a lot of suggestions but always forget them. We can achieve this with a reliable consumption tracking app.

We will know this to be true when users are able to discover new media with out having to waste time searching for it.
